                <h2>Building the Project</h2>
                <h3>Configuring the Build Process</h3>
                <p>Before any build is executed, the file <em>build.properties.template</em>
                  must be copied and the copy must be named <em>build.properties</em>.
                <p>This file must be edited using a text editor to reflect 
                  the local environment. (These property files as well as 
                  the files with a <em>.txt</em> extension are assumed to 
                  be in <em>ISO-8859-1</em> encoding, whereas all other text files 
                  are assumed to be encoded in <em>UTF-8</em>.) 
                <p>If the property <em>git</em> is left undefined, no
                  interaction with any repositories takes place during the build.
                  It is possible, nevertheless, to create the project binaries
                  from the downloaded source code.</p>
                <p>If the property <em>git</em> is defined but the project's
                  remote origin is the master branch (from the original git clone), 
                  each build will merge the remote master branch with the 
                  local repository and the current working copy, before 
                  the build is executed.</p>
                <p>If the project's origin is a development branch, the
                  source code that was successfully tested and built will be
                  pushed to that (remote) development branch.</p>
                <p>Only JDK 1.7 or 1.8 can be used for building
                  this project. JDK 1.9 is incompatible with the JAXB version
                  used.</p>
                  
                <p class="pull-right">
                  <small><a href="#" class="icon icon--before icon--power hidden-print">Top of page</a></small>
                </p>
                
                <h3>Need for Test Databases</h3>
                <p>In the <em>build.properties</em> some properties refer to test
                  databases for each supported DBMS. If those are given, the tests 
                  of the JDBC implementation for each DBMS are run as part of the 
                  build process. If <em>dbuser&lt;db&gt;</em> is undefined
                  the build process will skip the tests for the DBMS identified
                  by <em>&lt;db&gt;</em>.</p>
                  
                <p>For running the DB/2 tests it is necessary to be able to reach a running
                  DB/2 instance. For this instance a "normal" user (<em>dbuserdb2</em>)
                  as well as a DBA (database administrator) user <em>dbauserdb2</em>
                  must have been created. The DBA user is used in the tests
                  for creating the test databases (using <em>TestDb2Database</em> 
                  and <em>TestSqlDatabase</em> in package <em>ch.admin.bar.siard2.db2</em>) 
                  and granting privileges to the "normal" user for all parts
                  of the test databases. The "normal" user is then used in
                  the download and upload tests of <em>SiardCmd</em>.</p>
                  
                <p>For running the SQL Server tests it is necessary to be able to reach a running
                  SQL Server instance. For this instance a test user (<em>dbusermssql</em>)
                  must have been created who is owner of the database given in <em>dbcatalogmssql</em>.
                  It is used for creating the test databases (using <em>TestMsSqlDatabase</em> 
                  and <em>TestSqlDatabase</em> in package <em>ch.admin.bar.siard2.mssql</em>) 
                  The test databases are then used with this user in 
                  the download and upload tests of <em>SiardCmd</em>.</p>
                <p>For downloading the SQL Server sample database <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/c1071c28-84a6-48f7-af9e-8a9e70ee3008/adventure-works-2012?forum=sqlserversamples" target="_blank">AdventureWorks</a> the
                  credentials of the <em>dbuseraw</em> user must be defined.</p>
                  
                <p>For running the MySQL tests it is necessary to be able to reach a running
                  MySQL instance. For this instance a "normal" user (<em>dbusermysql</em>)
                  as well as a DBA (database administrator) user <em>dbausermysql</em>
                  must have been created. The DBA user is used in the tests
                  for creating the test databases (using <em>TestMySqlDatabase</em> 
                  and <em>TestSqlDatabase</em> in package <em>ch.admin.bar.siard2.mysql</em>) 
                  and granting privileges to the "normal" user for all parts
                  of the test databases. The "normal" user is then used in
                  the download and upload tests of <em>SiardCmd</em>.</p>
                  
                <p>For running the Oracle tests it is necessary to be able to reach a running
                  Oracle instance. For this instance a "normal" user (<em>dbuseroracle</em>)
                  as well as a DBA (database administrator) user <em>dbauseroracle</em>
                  must have been created. The DBA user is used in the tests
                  for creating the test databases (using <em>TestOracleDatabase</em> 
                  and <em>TestSqlDatabase</em> in package <em>ch.admin.bar.siard2.oracle</em>) 
                  and granting privileges to the "normal" user for all parts
                  of the test databases. The "normal" user is then used in
                  all tests of the JDBC interface.</p>
                <p>For the tests with Oracle datatype BFILE a share must be defined
                  which is located on the server where the Oracle instance is
                  running. In it a file must be given, that will serve as
                  the column data of the BFILE column.</p>
                <p>For downloading the Oracle sample schema <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B14117_01/server.101/b10771/scripts004.htm" target="_blank">OE</a> the
                  credentials of the <em>dbuseroe</em> user must be defined.</p>

                <h3>The Targets of the Build Process</h3>
                <p>All SIARD projects define a subset of the following targets in the
                  central Ant file <em>build.xml</em>:</p>
                <dl>
                  <dt>check</dt><dd>checks presence of <em>build.properties</em>, determines
                    new build date, reads version and revision from <em>src/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</em>,
                    and determines branch name from <em>.git/HEAD</em> and whether it is a <em>master</em> branch.</dd>
                  <dt>properties</dt><dd>Fails if <em>build.properties</em> are not present
                    ot insufficient</dd>
                  <dt>clean</dt><dd>deletes all folders and files which will be produced by the build</dd>
                  <dt>init</dt><dd>creates empty folders for build results</dd>
                  <dt>commit</dt><dd>adds and commits changes in the working copy to the local repository</dd>
                  <dt>pull</dt><dd>updates working copy from master and development branch</dd>
                  <dt>revision</dt><dd>increments the revision number and writes it and the build date to <em>src/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</em>.
                  <dt>generate</dt><dd>generates JAVA source files automatically from non-JAVA sources (using JAXB, ANTLR4, ...)</dd>
                  <dt>build</dt><dd>compiles the sources to the <em>build/classes</em> folder</dd>
                  <dt>jar</dt><dd>creates the JAR from the sources in the <em>dist</em> folder</dd>
                  <dt>test</dt><dd>compiles the (JUnit) tests to the <em>build/tests</em> and runs them using the JAR file in the <em>dist</em> folder.</dd>
                  <dt>javadoc</dt><dd>creates Javadoc documentation in the folder <em>doc/javadoc</em> of published APIs of the project</dd>
                  <dt>zip</dt><dd>zips the JAR and all other supporting documents of the binary release into the <em>dist</em> folder</dd>
                  <dt>push</dt><dd>pushes the tested sources of the build to the development branch, if the current project is not on the master branch</dd>
                  <dt>deploy</dt><dd>unzips the binary release to a temporary location from which it can be run</dd>   
                </dl>
                <p>It is sufficient to run the <em>deploy</em> task in order to achieve a complete build.</p>
                <p>After a fresh clone of the remote master branch, it is advisable to run the <em>generate</em> task if there is one defined.
                  Only then will the sources be complete and errors signaled in the IDE will disappear.</p>
               
                <p class="pull-right">
                  <small><a href="#" class="icon icon--before icon--power hidden-print">Top of page</a></small>
                </p>
                
                <h3>Creating a Remote Development Branch</h3>
                <p>Names of development branches should start with <em>dev</em>,
                  indicate the institution and - possibly - the person 
                  or task. Thus <em>dev/enter</em>, <em>dev/bar/marcel</em>
                  or <em>dev/enter/bug945</em> are good names for development 
                  branches.</p>
                <p>In order to create a branch <em>dev/enter</em> the command</p>
                <pre>git checkout -b dev/enter</pre>
                <p>must be executed in the project folder <em>SiardCmd</em>.</p>
                <p>The currently active branch is found in <em>.git/HEAD</em>,
                  which has the content</p>
                <pre>ref: refs/heads/dev/enter</pre>
                <p>as a result ot the previous command.</p>
                <p>This command will then create a branch with the same 
                  name in the remote repository:</p>
                <pre>git push origin dev/enter</pre>
                <p>When changes are pushed to the remote origin, the 
                  local changes will be merged to the branch with the 
                  same name.</p>
